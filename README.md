A Mindustry mod that have provides no buildigs,no materials and no missions but only planets that use SerpuloPlanetGenerator.  
serpulo clones. No techs provided. It is recommended that you play the original campaign first. 

A project to test if I can alter the generator for this planet via java scrips  
planet generator are altered by javascript. 

credits for source codes: 
Frozen Farlands https://github.com/ZielonyTrojkat/Frozen-Farlands for sucessfully changing the planetGenerator.

conclusion:
1. Increase planet size increases the map sixe. 
2. public functions can be overrided. 
3. cannot override the use of protected variables via public functions.  
4. Existing tiles that is not on Serpulo can be added to planets eg. Blocks.coreZone.
